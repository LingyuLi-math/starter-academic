The fractional order differential operator is obviously different from the integer order differential operator, which has non-locality. It is this global property of the fractional operator that makes it very suitable for describing materials with memory and genetic properties in the real world, and becomes a powerful tool for simulating pollutant transport in porous media. Efficient numerical simulation of fractional differential equations has become a frontier problem in related fields.
