abstract: The analytical solution of the convection diffusion equation is considered by two-dimensional Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier transform. To get the numerical solution, the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method is constructed, which is second-order accurate in time and space. Numerical simulation shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution. The dynamic visualization of the simulating results is realized on ArcGIS platform. This work provides a quick and intuitive decision-making basis for water resources protection, especially in dealing with water pollution emergencies.
